In Jacobi, each iteration is done using a set of previous values, even if 
new values become available in the middle of an iteration. 
In Gauss-Seidel, as soon as you have a new iterate for a particular component, you use it for all subsequent computation.

If you study the computational form of Gauss-Seidel, you should find 
that it becomes identical to Jacobi if you take the kth generation iterates
instead of the (k+1)th generation iterates, for the summation that handles
values to the left of the main diagonal of your matrix.

Gauss elimination involves combining equations to eliminate unknowns.
The fundamental idea of this equation is to add multiples of one equation to other and to eliminate one variable 
and to continue this process until only one variable is left.
